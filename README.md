Side projects should be about code therapy not grinding.

Future features:

0. Add owner field
   - Add description and title fields
   - Add likes, an array of distinct user ids
1. Delete
2. Like
3. Report (flag)
4. Cat-verification
5. Top-cat
6. Multi-cat
7. Add width and height of image to Cat object, use it to inform next/image of size before image loads.
8. Save cat card
9. Create vim plugin for autotag delete in normal mode (I think an insert, delete line, back to normal mode would do it? Also could explore an actual lua function)
